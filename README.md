# 👋 Hi, I'm Diya!

I'm currently diving deep into **Data Structures & Algorithms** using C++, and building modern web apps with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
Lately, I've been exploring the world of **AI**, including **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

## 🚀 Projects

Here are a couple of projects I’m proud of:

- 🔗 [AI Powered PDF Summarizer](https://github.com/diyavcodes/PDF-Summarizer-)  
  Developed a Streamlit web app that summarizes uploaded PDFs using Google’s Gemini model and extracts key terms using YAKE.

- 🔗 [The Hostel Helper](https://github.com/diyavcodes/thehostelhelper-website)  
  Built a web platform to simplify hostel discovery and move-in for college students
